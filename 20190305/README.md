## 2019-03-05. Landlab modeling framework and use cases

**Amanda Manaster and Sai S. Nudurupati, UW Civil & Environmental Engineering**

[Landlab](http://landlab.github.io) is an open-source Python toolkit that provides a modeling environment for building 2D numerical Earth surface models. This toolkit is designed to accelerate the development of new process-based models by providing: tools to create a grid; data structures for storing and managing data on the grid; and easy-to-use plotting and visualization functions. In this cyberseminar, we will walk through the basics of Landlab using HydroShare, including a simple example of an Earth surface model. In addition, we will provide two more water-specific examples—an Overland Flow example and an Ecohydrology example—for further independent exploration. We will discuss the two additional examples in detail during WaterHackWeek. No prior experience is required, but a basic understanding of HydroShare and Python is helpful.

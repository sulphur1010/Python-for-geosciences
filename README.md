Python in the Geosciences
====
**Ongoing (Fall 2015-present) Seminar - University of Washington**

### Time:

1st Tuesday of the month, 3:30PM

### Location:

6th floor of the [Physics/Astronomy Tower (PAT)](http://uw.edu/maps?pat), WRF Data Science Studio, Seminar Room C607 or C610

### Background:

In recent years, the Python programming language has emerged as a popular choice for geoscientists. Python is an easy to learn, easy to read, fast to write, open source, multi-platform platform language. Accompanying the Python language is a large community of free, open source projects that have facilitated rapid scientific development and data analysis. This informal seminar series focuses on new and existing Python tools and applications within the geoscience community and aims to connect Python users across the UW campus.

This seminar series was started in Fall 2015 by [Joe Hamman](https://github.com/jhamman/) (NCAR but Seattle based; formerly at UW-CEE) and [Emilio Mayorga](https://github.com/emiliom/) (UW-APL), and is currently coordinated by Emilio with help from Anthony Arendt (UW-APL & eScience Institute). Thanks go to the [eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu) for their support in hosting the seminars from the start, and to [Don Setiawan](https://github.com/lsetiawan/) (UW Oceanography & eScience, formerly at UW-APL) for his past help.

### Instructions for presenters

Please send us a final title and a brief summary/abstract by Sunday before the seminar. [Here's an example of a good abstract](https://github.com/uwescience/Python-for-geosciences/blob/master/20181106/README.md), but there are many others in the seminar web site. In the abstract, try to touch on what science you're addressing, what methods you use, and main Python tools / packages you use.

Some general information about the seminars and logistics:

- We have one hour for the seminar. Typically you can plan on speaking through the end, but with interruptions for questions and interactions throughout the hour. We usually have about 10-15 people.
- A mix of slides and active demos (running code live) usually works best. But it's obviously up to you.
- We have a good UW WiFi connection

### Other Workshops / Seminars / Resources:
- Atmos-Python Workshop: atmos-python@uw.edu (Andre or Jeremy -- not sure if these are still going)
- Others?
